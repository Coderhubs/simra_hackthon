- [X] T009 Generate Chapter 8: Future Trends and Research Directions in frontend/docs/chapter-8-future-trends.md

## Phase 3: Advanced Topics and Applications (Revised Outline)
- [ ] T010 [US11] Generate Chapter 11: Isaac Sim for Humanoids in frontend/docs/chapter-11-isaac-sim-humanoids.md
- [ ] T011 [US12] Generate Chapter 12: Manipulation and Grasping in frontend/docs/chapter-12-manipulation-grasping.md
- [ ] T012 [US13] Generate Chapter 13: Embodied AI and Foundation Models in frontend/docs/chapter-13-embodied-ai-foundation-models.md
- [ ] T013 [US14] Generate Chapter 14: Physical AI for Real-World Robots in frontend/docs/chapter-14-physical-ai-real-world-robots.md

## Phase 4: Final Project and Conclusion (Revised Outline)
- [ ] T014 [US15] Generate Chapter 15: Final Humanoid Project in frontend/docs/chapter-15-final-humanoid-project.md
- [ ] T015 Review all chapters for consistency, clarity, and accuracy
- [ ] T016 Update table of contents or sidebar navigation in frontend/docs/sidebars.ts
- [ ] T017 Ensure all generated chapters are correctly linked and navigable

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 must be completed before Phase 2.
- Phase 2 must be completed before Phase 3.
- Each chapter within Phase 3 and 4 can be considered largely independent, but are listed sequentially for logical flow.
- Phase 4 requires completion of prior phases.

## Implementation Strategy
- Focus on completing one chapter at a time, ensuring quality before moving to the next.
- Prioritize core concepts and clear explanations for each chapter.
- Iterate and refine based on review.
