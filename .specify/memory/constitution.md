# AI-native textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Purpose
Educate and empower a diverse audience to understand, develop, and innovate in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, leveraging AI-native features like RAG chatbot, personalization, and multi-language support.

## Audience
Developers, researchers, students, and enthusiasts in AI and robotics, including those in Urdu-speaking regions.

## Writing Style
Clear, concise, technically accurate, engaging, and accessible, suitable for a Docusaurus book format, incorporating examples and practical applications.

## Core Principles

### Structure Principle 1: Modularity and Navigability
The textbook will be structured into logical modules, chapters, and sections to ensure ease of navigation and comprehension. Content should be easily discoverable and cross-referenced.

### Structure Principle 2: AI-Native Integration
The textbook will leverage AI-native features such as a RAG chatbot for interactive Q&A, personalization of learning paths, and seamless integration with Claude Code subagents for hands-on exercises and exploration. Urdu translation will be a core feature.

### Structure Principle 3: Practical Application & Hands-on Learning
Content will prioritize practical applications, code examples, and interactive simulations where applicable, fostering a hands-on learning experience. Claude Code subagents will facilitate direct experimentation.

### Quality Standard 1: Technical Accuracy and Rigor
All technical content must be accurate, up-to-date, and rigorously reviewed by subject matter experts. Concepts should be explained with precision and clarity.

### Quality Standard 2: Clarity and Accessibility
Content must be presented in a clear, concise, and accessible manner, avoiding unnecessary jargon while maintaining technical depth. Language should be inclusive and easy to understand for the target audience, including Urdu speakers.

### Quality Standard 3: Interactivity and Engagement
The textbook will actively engage learners through interactive elements, thought-provoking questions, practical exercises, and the RAG chatbot, encouraging active participation and deeper understanding.

## Governance

Amendments to these principles require consensus among project leads and contributors, followed by a minor version bump and documentation in the commit history. The constitution follows semantic versioning: MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for new principles, PATCH for clarifications. All changes documented. Regular reviews (quarterly) will ensure ongoing compliance with these principles and alignment with project goals and hackathon requirements.
